# Dashboard Deep Dive

## Real-Time Visualization Components

### 1. Status Bar

Quick-glance system overview updated every 200ms:

- System Status: ACTIVE / CAUTION / HIGH RISK (color-coded)
- Current Infusion Rate: Real-time ml/min with trend indicator
- 24-Hour Cumulative Volume: Running total with safety threshold
- Session Time: Elapsed time since system start

### 2. Vital Signs Panel

Six critical parameters with intelligent status indicators:

- Hydration: 🟢 >65% | 🟡 60-65% | 🔴 <60%
- Heart Rate: 🟢 60-100 bpm | 🟡 100-120 | 🔴 >120 or <50
- SpO₂: 🟢 >95% | 🟡 90-95% | 🔴 <90%
- Temperature: 🟢 36.5-37.5°C | 🟡 edges | 🔴 <35 or >39°C
- Lactate: 🟢 <3 mmol/L | 🟡 3-4 | 🔴 >4
- Cardiac Output: Continuously monitored (5±1 L/min normal)

### 3. Energy Transfer Dynamics

Complete visualization of Section 4.1 physics:

- Energy Proxy (E_T): Visual bar chart (0-1 scale)
- Absolute Energy Transfer: W/kg real-time calculation
- Flow Velocity: Estimated from cardiac output (target: 15-25 cm/s)
- Flow Efficiency G(v): Gaussian term showing delivery optimization
- Metabolic Load: Composite stress indicator
- Tissue Efficiency (η): Perfusion-adjusted absorption

### 4. Risk Assessment Dashboard

Multi-domain risk quantification:

**Composite Risk Score:** Weighted combination (0-1 scale)
- 60% Critical factors (blood loss, hypoxia, hypothermia)
- 30% Metabolic factors (dehydration, energy depletion)
- 10% Thermal stress (hyperthermia)

- Cardiac Reserve: Real-time headroom calculation
- Signal Coherence (σ): Data quality and reliability metric

### 5. Control System Panel

Transparent AI decision-making:

- Desired Rate: Controller output before safety constraints
- Actual Rate: Safety-limited commanded rate
- Confidence: Inverse of state uncertainty
- Hydration Urgency: Nonlinear deficit calculation
- Energy Need: Gap × metabolic load amplification

### 6. Predictive Outlook (10-Minute Horizon)

Forward state estimation:

- Predicted Hydration: Linear extrapolation with uncertainty
- Predicted Energy_T: Trend-based forecast
- Recommended Action: "Nominal" vs "⚠️ Preemptive boost +20%"

### 7. Trend Charts (30-Minute Rolling Window)

Two synchronized time-series plots:

- Chart A: Hydration (%) and Energy_T (scaled 0-100)
- Chart B: Infusion Rate (ml/min) and Cardiac Reserve (0-1)
- Update interval: 10 seconds (reduce visual noise while maintaining responsiveness)

### 8. Alert Panel

Hierarchical warning system:

- 🟢 No Alerts: "✓ All systems nominal"
- 🟡 Warnings: Moderate deviations (hydration <60%, HR >100)
- 🔴 Critical: Immediate attention required (cardiac reserve <0.3, risk >0.75)
- Auto-prioritizes most severe alert
- Actionable guidance ("Infusion limited due to low cardiac reserve")

## Dashboard Modes

### Mode 1: Standalone Simulation (Current Implementation)

- Embedded physiological simulator
- Matches C++ control algorithm exactly
- Self-contained demonstration (no server required)
- Suitable for: Education, training, regulatory demos

### Mode 2: Live API Integration (Future Enhancement)

```javascript
// WebSocket connection to C++ backend
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080/ai_iv_stream');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const telemetry = JSON.parse(event.data);
    updateDashboard(telemetry);
};
```

### Mode 3: CSV Playback (Future Enhancement)

- Import session logs for retrospective analysis
- Variable-speed replay (0.5×, 1×, 2×, 5×)
- Comparative analysis of multiple sessions
- Quality improvement and research
