# System Architecture Overview

The AI-Optimized IV Therapy Control System is designed as a modular,
closed-loop control architecture separating:

- State estimation
- Predictive modeling
- Control logic
- Safety enforcement
- Visualization

This separation enables independent validation, testing, and future
hardware integration while preserving safety guarantees.
